 * A hook for use within an `OpenLayerObserver` component. It provides access to:
 *
 * - `getCount`: a function that returns the current count of open layers under the observer.
 * - `onChange`: a function that allows you to subscribe to changes in the layer count. It returns a
 * cleanup function to unsubscribe, which you should call when the component unmounts.
 * - `closeLayers`: a function that closes all open layers.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```tsx
 * const openLayerObserver = useOpenLayerObserver();
 * useEffect(() => {
 *   return openLayerObserver.onChange(function onChange({ count }) {
 *     // react to changes in the layer count
 *   });
 * }, [openLayerObserver]);
 * ```

/**
 * **Note: this hook will be cleaned up with fg('platform_dst_open_layer_observer_close_layers'), and replaced by `useOpenLayerObserver`.**
 *
 * Variant of `useOpenLayerObserver()` that will _not_ throw an error if the hook is used outside of an `OpenLayerObserver`.
 * Instead, it will return `null`.
 *
 * This is to enable progressive rollout of fg('platform_dst_open_layer_observer_close_layers'), which moves the `OpenLayerObserver`
 * provider from the nav4 `SideNav` slot to the `Root`.
 *
 * A separate hook is required as we cannot conditionally call React hooks based on a feature flag value, and it is unsafe to call
 * `useOpenLayerObserver()` in components that are not rendered inside the SideNav - such as `PanelSplitter` components rendered
 * inside the `Aside` slot.
